<br />
If there are any problems about the container type we need information immediately so we can react accordingly. Please put one carton of each item in front of the container to avoid costs for customs examination. Please send photos of container loading on which we can clearly see that the different cartons are right at the door. We need this for our reference and to avoid misunderstandings and disputes. Otherwise, we will charge costs for customs examination to your account anyway. Please send the booking confirmation for our information by email once you have booked the vessel! FUMIGATION: Container may be only fumigated, if you use wood-packing materials that contain solid wood / timber and logs. Donâ€™t fumigate a container for cardboard boxes, plywood, blockboard, MDF/HDF (wood-based products obtained by pressing wood fibres), OSB (a competitor for plywood), hardboard, particle board and some other man-made boards! Fumigation certificate must be provided with shipment documents!<br />
